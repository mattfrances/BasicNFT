# My basic NFT project

This project was used for educational purposes for learning how to build and launch basic NFTs. I followed the \_buildpsace course you can find [here](https://buildspace.so/).

The NFT randomly generates a sequence of 3 words from a predefined set of word options. Those 3 words are added to a black square background, and minted as an NFT. A sample collection can be found [here](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/squarenft-gr0sec1kuj).
